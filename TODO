TODO List
=========

* Choose license, add the COPYING file

* Gimp 2.8 makes significant changes to file handling (now saving
  versus exporting).  Anyway, I think we anticipate not having saving
  and loading of masks in the plugin anymore (or at least not saving).

* Do we want this new plugin in its own git repo at some point?

* Dialog is too high for my 1366x768 laptop

* You have to select *something* to even get the dialog to appear.
  (Currently, this selection determines the preview window.)  We need to make
  sure the dialog always appears, no matter what.

* Selection clips the binary mask: probably not what user expects.
  She would want to edit the mask (in a layer) for the entire image domain

* Dialog won't open if inpaint region is too big (more than 500 px wide?)
  Related to the preview I assume.
  Sometimes there is an error:

  ** (inpaint-BCT:22855): WARNING **: fill_stop_path_buffer_from_path with path_id = -1
*** Error in `/home/cbm/.gimp-2.8/plug-ins/inpaint-BCT': malloc(): memory corruption (fast): 0x0000000000e26ec0 ***
*** Error in `/home/cbm/.gimp-2.8/plug-ins/inpaint-BCT': malloc(): memory corruption (fast): 0x0000000000e26e30 ***

* Plugin can write to a locked image layer (!)  Sort of sounds like a gimp bug to me, but still...
